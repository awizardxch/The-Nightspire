## Backlog

### 🎲 Game Hub (chia-gaming)
- [x] Games tab: catalog, hub picker, embedded client, pinned revision shown (`src/components/HubTab.tsx`, `src/lib/gameHub.ts`, `src/store/hubStore.ts`)
- [ ] Deploy the Nightspire hub on Railway at `hub.awizard.dev` (`hub/README.md`; image and fetch tested locally)
- [x] Client served at `/games`: the `game-client` workflow publishes a release, the Vercel build fetches it (docs/GAME_HUB.md)
- [ ] Add the Vercel deploy hook as repo secret `VERCEL_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL`; set `VITE_GAME_CLIENT_URL=https://play.awizard.dev/games`
- [x] Client patch: `?hub=` prefills the hub picker (`game-client/patches/`)
- [x] Client patch: hub base URLs with a path (required for Discord), tested behind a prefix proxy (`game-client/e2e/run.sh`)
- [ ] Offer the hub-path patch upstream to Chia-Network/chia-gaming
- [ ] Client page: WalletConnect relay rewrite for Discord, as in our `index.html`
- [ ] Discord URL mapping: `/hub/nightspire` (the client at `/games` is covered by `/`)
- [ ] End-to-end: two players on the Nightspire hub play California Poker on testnet11 (web), then in Discord
- [ ] No-value game CAT for the Discord build (no DEX pools, no swaps)
- [x] Love Slots free play in The Nightspire (no wallet, no chain)
- [ ] Love Slots for value: `games/lovespin` channel game + Love Draw puzzles (aWizard-Familiar docs/slots/LOVE_SLOTS_SPEC.md)

### ⏸️ Paused
- Battle of Wizards fighter battles (tab removed; code kept). The state-channel items below that mention BattleTab are on hold with it.
- `stateChannel.ts` / `channelOpen.ts` are superseded by chia-gaming; port Chellyz to a chia-gaming game instead of extending them.


### ⚡ State Channel Battles (Mainnet)
- [x] **Align channelOpen.ts with bow-app real CLVM coin spend**
  - `buildStandardSolution(puzHash, amount, memo)` ported from bow-app — REMARK + CREATE_COIN via greenwebjs
  - `greenwebjs@1.1.9` installed; Vite `optimizeDeps.include` set so CJS pre-bundles correctly
  - Puzzle hash taken directly from coin returned by `getSpendableCoin()` — no bech32m decode needed
- [ ] **Wire Chellyz game start → open state channel (1 mojo, mainnet)**
  - `ChellyzTab` "Start Game" button triggers `useLobbyStore.openGymLobby()` before entering play
  - Show Sage wallet signing prompt before allowing the first card play
  - On sign success: store `channelId` + `coinId` in Chellyz game context
- [ ] **Wire Battle tab → open state channel before battle loop**
  - `BattleTab` "Start Battle" prompts `useLobbyStore.openGymLobby()` first
  - Channel must be `'locked'` before moves are accepted
- [ ] **Bond type UI selector in LobbyTab**
  - Radio/select: XCH Mojo (default) | CAT (coming soon, disabled) | NFT Bond (coming soon, disabled)
  - `useLobbyStore.setBondType()` already wired
- [ ] **CAT bond support (future)**
  - When `bondType === 'cat'`: call `chip0002_getAssetCoins` with `asset_id: bondCatAssetId, type: 'CAT'`
  - Store `bondCatAssetId` in `StateChannel.bondCatAssetId`
- [ ] **NFT bond support (future)**
  - When `bondType === 'nft'`: use NFT launcher ID as collateral
  - Requires Chia DID / NFT puzzle lock (out of scope for v1 alpha)
- [ ] **Channel settlement flow**
  - After Chellyz or Battle ends, call `sendFundingBundle` with a settlement memo
  - Update tracker with `stateChannelStatus: 'settled'`
  - Show confetti + APS change on win

### 🔐 Authentication & Access
- [ ] NFT-gated access: verify user holds a specific collection NFT (`/api/nft/gate`)
- [ ] Fallback: Discord role-based access if NFT gate is disabled
- [ ] Session persistence (refresh without re-auth)

### 🧙 aWizard Chat Panel
- [ ] Connect to external aWizard bot REST API (`VITE_AWIZARD_BOT_URL/chat`)
- [ ] Render bot responses as markdown
- [ ] Action buttons from `WizardAction[]` responses (navigate, toast, link)
- [ ] Typing indicator while waiting for bot reply

### ⚔️ Battle System
- [ ] Implement commit/reveal move submission UI
- [ ] Wire `PrivacyBattleEngine` to live PvP round loop
- [ ] Connect to gym-server `/gym/` endpoints for PvE battles
- [ ] Deep-link from Activity → bow-app for wallet-heavy flows
- [ ] Show live HP bars, move log, round counter during battle
- [ ] Battle result screen (APS delta, winner, rematch button)
- [ ] PvP: replace local engine with PeerJS P2P round loop

### 🔮 NFT Deep Scan (trait loading)
- [ ] `chia_getNfts` returns NFT shells only — traits are NOT inline
- [ ] After loading NFTs, fetch `metadataUris[0]` for each NFT to get: `tier`, `wins`, `losses`, `arcane_power_score`, `strength`, `weakness`, `effect`
- [x] Cache fetched metadata in session storage to avoid re-fetch on every load
- [ ] Handle CORS / IPFS redirect for external metadata URIs
- [ ] Once metadata is loaded, re-parse fighters with `nftToFighterData` for accurate stats
- [ ] Show loading skeleton per NFT card as metadata streams in

### 📡 Tracker / PvP Matchmaking
- [ ] Room list UI — browse open `TrackerClient` rooms
- [ ] Create room flow — announce to tracker, share room link
- [ ] Join room flow — select from list, update player 2 fields
- [ ] PeerJS connection setup after both players announce

### 🎨 NFT Viewer
- [ ] Fetch via bow-app `/api/nft/:nftId` route
- [ ] Display NFT metadata, tier, APS, effect
- [ ] Approved-collection badge (Chellyz genesis highlight)

### 🏆 Leaderboard
- [ ] Fetch rankings from tracker scrape endpoint
- [ ] Highlight current user's rank and APS
- [ ] Filter by game type / tier

### 🚀 Deployment
- [ ] Discord Developer Portal URL mapping (Vercel prod URL)
- [ ] CI: GitHub Actions build + deploy on push to `main`
- [ ] Clean up `console.log` debug statements for production
- [ ] Code-split large bundle (currently ~1 MB) via dynamic imports
- [ ] Test full wallet → fighter select → battle flow end-to-end
